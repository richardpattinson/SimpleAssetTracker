# Clarificaitons for the Client

Do we want all assets to be displayed on the landing page or for them to only be loaded on the search page?

How many levels of access should we make? 3 levels of access, superuser, administrator and user is the current thinking.

Should companies have to host this software on their own servers or should it be hosted externally on a SAAS basis?
